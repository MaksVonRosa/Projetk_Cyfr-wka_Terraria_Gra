WARNING: [Place 46-29] Timing had been disabled during Placer and, therefore, physical synthesis in Placer will be skipped.
WARNING: [Timing 38-313] There are no user specified timing constraints. Timing constraints are needed for proper timing analysis.
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design! Power estimation will be inaccurate until this is corrected.
